Do you ever listen to a song, really like it, but don't know the lyrics?
With Spotipy and LyricsGenius API, I have created a program that searches for and returns the lyrics to whatever song is playing on your computer, as long as you're using Spotify.
To do this, you require access tokens for both Spotipy AND LyricsGenius...

Spotify API: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api
Spotipy API: https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.16.1/
Genius API Client: https://genius.com/api-clients
LyricsGenius API: https://lyricsgenius.readthedocs.io/en/master/

Just play a song, run the program, and sing along!
